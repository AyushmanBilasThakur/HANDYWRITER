# [HANDY-WRITE || WRITE MARKDOWN AND GET YOUR HTML](https://ayushmanbilasthakur.github.io/HANDYWRITER/)

## About This Project

This project idea came to my mind when I found a markdown writer for android named writer+. So I thought that it would be cool to make a web version of that app so that I can see the formatted version of the markdown flie as well as download the HTML version and the Rich Text File version of the file. I'm planning to make the desktop as well as an android version of this app
